This directory contains source and header files for classes related to
controlling the displays on the CanvasView.  These classes implement
the application logic independent of the Graphical User Interface or
the scripting language.  That is, the goal is that application logic
should be in one of the controller classes and not in a classes that
supports the user interface.

@note The above goal has not been 100% acheived.

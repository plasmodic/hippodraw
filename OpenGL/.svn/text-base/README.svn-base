  This a first draft of an OpenGL driver for hippodraw.

  One idea would be to handle the graphic with OpenGL
 and deleguate the handling of the OpenGL connection 
 to windowing system to various GUI toolkit or "high level"
 graphic system, like OpenInventor.

  An interesting job, would be to open some OpenGL 
 widget with Qt and have the OpenGL driver draw in it.
 This would open hippodraw to the world of 3D graphic
 without breaking the today choice of Qt to handle the GUI...

  Another thread of idea would be to have an Inventor 
 SoNode wrapping of the OpenGL hippodraw driver 
 to be able to have hippodraw working within an OpenInventor 
 context. This is a way I want to prospect at LAL...

  The OpenGLView is pure OpenGL. OpenGLApp and OpenGLWindow
 does the connection to X11. Today there is no code to connect
 to non-X11 OpenGL (mainly pure Windows and pure Apple 
 windoing system).

  Today the related library and code can be reconstructed
 with CMT only.

  Notes :
  -----
 - The TextTTF.cxx file should be compiled with the HAVE_TTF
   cpp macro in order to use the TTF fonts. On UNIXes the freetype
   library must be installed (it should come with any good Linux 
   installation).
 - a times.ttf default file is provided.
 
  Todo :
  ----
 - Have OpenGLApp, OpenGLWindow versions for pure Windows 
   and Apple windowing system.
 - be able to build libhippogl, libhippoglx libraries and 
   hippoTestOpenGL program with the configure system.

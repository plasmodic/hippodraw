A few other packages may be required for the working of a few test suites.
(and hence in general a few programs utilizing those features). For example

1. m51.py requires pyfits. 	 

2. erget.py requires numarray 0.4 together with pyfits. The numarray
version required is 0.4 which is an older version with which the pyfits is
compatible.  

These packages can be found at the following locations together with the
install instructions at the pyfits home page:

Please note IN SPITE of the claims made in above page that pyfits works with
numarray 0.4 and ABOVE we have observed that use of any higher version
leads to incompatibilities and hence urge users to use version 0.4 ONLY.

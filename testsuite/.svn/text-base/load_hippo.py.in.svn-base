This loads the hippoplotter module and exposes the hippo, app, and
canvas references to the importing script. The _plot reference will
remain hidden.  

Importing this module is preferable to the sequence

from hippo import HDapp
app = HDapp()
canvas = app.canvas()

since the import mechanism ensures that only one instance of HDapp
is created.  The hippoplotter module is used to ensure cooperation
with existing scripts that import that module.

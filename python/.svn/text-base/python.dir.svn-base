/** @dir python

This directory contains source and header files of classes related to
a python extension module.

This directory contains source and header files of classes related to
a python extension module built with Boost.Python.  It also contains a
derived class of DataSource, and ListTuple  that uses Python list objects.
In addition, there are several Python files used by the hippoplotter module.
The <em> pyfits.py </em> comes from
<a href="http://www.stsci.edu/resources/software_hardware/pyfits"> PyFITS </a> project and is included here for convenience.

@bug @@ hsimple.py and pl_exp_test.py, don't do anything under
run_test_scripts.py.  (This isn't a bug.  run_test_scripts.py launches
scripts using the import command.  Since hsimple.py and pl_exp_test.py
are launched by SciPy_demo.py before they are launched by
run_test_scripts.py, Python's import mechanism prevents the scripts
from being re-run.)

/** @page starting_root Getting Started with HippoDraw without Python

After starting the @b HippoDraw application, either as a stand a lone
application or as Python extension module two windows should appear.
The left hand window is the canvas window upon which plots will be
drawn.  The right hand, smaller window is called the <b>%Inspector</b>.  One
uses the <b>%Inspector</b> create and modify plots in the canvas
window.

An @ref ntuple_root file can be imported using the file menu.  See @ref files_root for description of the file formats available.

To read a ROOT file, for example, click on the @b File menu at the
upper left of the canvas window and select <b> Import ROOT ntuple</b>.
as shown below

A file browser should appear.  A short cut to using the mouse to find
the file is to type at least part of the path to the file and hitting
@b enter as show below.

@image latex file_browser.eps The file browser.

Then double click on the folder icons the remainder of the path until
one finds the file as shown below.

Then one can double click on the file name or click the @b Open button.

The following might appear in your shell window where you stared the
application.

@verbatim
>>> Warning: environment variable ROOTSYS is not set. Standard include files ignored
Error: cannot open file "bool.h"  FILE: LINE:0
@endverbatim

Well its true, you don't have to set shell environment @em ROOTSYS
when reading ROOT files with @b HippoDraw.  If seeing this message
annoys you, set your @em ROOTSYS environment variable to anything and it
will go away.

At this point, the %Inspector will be showing you in its @b %NTuple @b
name box the name of the file and the name of the ROOT TTree that is
ready to use.

To create a histogram, choose the variable you want to histogram from
the @b X: combo box, then click on the @b New @b plot button.


At this point, the lower box of the %Inspector shows status of
currently selected plot as shown below

@image html insp_data.png The %Inspector showing selected plot.
@image latex insp_data.eps The %Inspector showing selected plot.


You can modify it from there.  For example,
try putting the mouse cursor over the @b X: combo box and without
clicking use the scroll wheel on the mouse.  The histogram should
change to the next variable in the ROOT file.  Of course you can click
on the combo box as well.

After changing the Y axis to a log scale in this example, the canvas
window should appear like shown below.

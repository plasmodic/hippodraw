/** @page slac_root Using HippoDraw on SLAC Linux Systems

@b HippoDraw is installed at SLAC for use by Red Hat Enterprise Linux
3 and 4 machines including AMD 64 bit machines.  This includes both
SLAC Computing Services (SCCS) public machines (noric) and most
desktop machines maintained by SCCS.

If you have a SLAC UNIX account, you can log into a public machine as
shown below.

@verbatim
libra3> ssh noric
RHEL WS 3 (Taroon Update 6)   2.4.21-40.ELsmp (2x1793MHz AMD Opteron)

@section slac_standalone Using HippoDraw as a stand a lone application.

HippoDraw can be used as stand a lone application, It has been
installed in various locations by various groups.  The most recent
version can be started as show below.

@verbatim
noric13> /afs/slac/g/ki/bin/hippodraw
@endverbatim

Note that no environment shell variables need to be set.  If you use
@b HippoDraw often, you may want to add the path @em
/afs/slac/g/ki/bin in your PATH environment variable.  But be aware of
(or benefit from), that fact that this directory contains newer
versions of frequently used programs then typically found in the SCCS
maintained @em /usr/local.

See @ref starting_root for help in learning to use @b
HippoDraw as a stand-a-lone application.


@section slac_python Using HippoDraw as a Python extension module.

the @b HippoDraw Python extension module has been installed in <em>
/afs/slac/g/ki/lib/python2.4/site-packages</em>.
This version also
contains the optional support for FITS, ROOT files as well as
numarray, Minuit, and WCSlib support.

To start a session with @b HippoDraw, first
start the Python interactive shell as shown below.

@verbatim
noric07> /afs/slac/g/ki/bin/python
Python 2.4.3 (#3, Jan 13 2006, 14:07:52)
[GCC 3.2.3 20030502 (Red Hat Linux 3.2.3-52)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
@endverbatim

Or, if this @em bin directory is in your @em PATH, then just type @em python.

Next, import @b HippoDraw into the Python session as show below

@verbatim
>>> import hippo
>>>
@endverbatim

The last step is to create the @b HippoDraw application as show below

@verbatim
>>> app = hippo.HDApp()
>>>
@endverbatim

You'll more likely be putting these commands in a file and have Python
interpret them at startup.  See @ref examples_page
for more information.

/**
@page canvas_root Canvas Window Users Guide

Most users of @b HippoDraw will use the %CanvasWindow.  It is called a
canvas because plots entered upon it can be moved around and resized,
just like graphic objects in a typical drawing program.  The canvas
can be extended over multiple pages.  The canvas and all its items can
be saved to a document file and previously saved documents can be open
at a later date.  The document file format is
<a href="http://www.w3.org/XML/">XML</a>.

  The document files never save any @ref ntuple_root objects used by the canvas
items, rather a reference to the data source file is saved as a relative
path.  If the data in the data source file has changed since the document
was saved, then when the document is opened, the plots display the
data source's new data.   

   The CanvasWindow looks like this ...

@image html canvaswindow.png A canvas window
@image latex canvaswindow.eps "A canvas window" width=\textwidth

Under the menu bar, there are 4 detachable tool bars, containing short
cuts to the most frequently used menu items.  One can right click on
the tool bar to show or hide individual tool bars.


@section canvas_mouse Control with the mouse

   Both canvas window controls and @ref inspector_root act on the <em>
selected canvas item </em> One selects an item with a left mouse click
with the mouse cursor over the item.   The item then appears like this ...

@image html canvasitemselected.png A canvas item in selected state
@image latex canvasitemselected.eps A canvas item in selected state

The canvas item shows it is selected by having a light gray rectangle
around it.  Note the @em knobs on the rectangle.  One can click and
drag on these to resize the item.  To move the item, click and drag on
the item but away from the knobs.  Multiple items can be selected
by doing a @em shift-click.  When multiple data representations are on
the same plot, then @em control-click is used to select among them.

Holding down the right mouse button turns the mouse cursor into a set of
cross hairs.  Also the data coordinate of the position of the cross
hairs is shown in the canvas window status bar.   This is illustrated below.

@image latex canvaswindowrightmouse.eps "Canvas window with right mouse down" width=\textwidth 

The right mouse button can also be used to change the range of cuts.
There are three cut modes to be selected from tool bar or the view menu. 
In <b>Drag edge</b> mode, just hold the right mouse button down, the edge or 
corner of the cut nearest the mouse down can then be dragged.  In <b>Click
edge</b> mode, click the right mouse button to select the two edges for 1D cut 
plotter, or two corners for 2D cut plotter.  In <b>Drag cut</b> mode, hold 
the right mouse button down, then drag to move the cut range.  A change of 
the cut range using right mouse button is shown below.

@section canvas_menu Menu and tool bar controls

   The controls offered by the CanvasWindow are mostly menu items.
However, some frequently used controls also have a icon on the tool
bar and a keyboard short cut.  Shown below is a more detailed view of
the menu bar and the task bar.

@image html canvaswindowdetail.png Detail of menu bar and tool bar
@image latex canvaswindowdetail.eps Detail of menu bar and tool bar

The tool bar icon are convenient shortcuts to a control, but it is not
always obvious from the icon what the control action will be.  To
verify what the icon does, hold the mouse cursor over the icon for a
few seconds.  A tool tip will appear describing the control.  Also the
keyboard short cut, if any, will be display in the tool tip and the
canvas window status bar.  Also, the same icon is used in toolbar and
menu item.


Like tool bars in most applications, the tool bar can be moved to
either side or the bottom of the CanvasWindow.  To do so, click and
drag on the vertical handle, which is at the extreme left in the
illustration above.

The remainder of this page is divided into the following subsections

@li @ref canvas_menu_file
@li @ref canvas_edit_menu
@li @ref canvas_view_menu
@li @ref canvas_view_settings
@li @ref canvas_view_about


@subsection canvas_menu_file File menu

The file menu has controls for handling files, printing, and
terminating the application.  It is shown below.

@image html menu_file.png File menu
@image latex menu_file.eps File menu

The actions of most of the menu items is pretty obvious.  The icon
used by the tool bar control is shown alongside the menu item along
with its keyboard shortcut, if any.   

The first two items creates a new canvas window, opens and existing
one.  The @b Browse... item opens an existing canvas in browse mode.
That is, the canvas is off screen and plot selection dialog is
displayed.  By choosing a display from this dialog, one can make a
copy of the display to the canvas window.


The @ b Save item is used to save the current canvas to a file.  The
<b> Save As... </b> menu items allows one to save the current canvas
to a different file.  By default the suffix @em .hpo is used for
canvas document files.  If the canvas is a new one and has not yet
been saved to a file, than the menu items @b Save and <b> Save
As... </b> are equivalent.

The @b Open menu item also allows one to open a file of different
types.  The default is to show all files.
By using the <b> File type </b> control, one can
also open a data source file.  Under UNIX-like systems, one can use
the mouse wheel to scroll through the options.  This doesn't work
under Windows because the Windows native file dialog is used and it
doesn't support it.

Data sources in @b HippoDraw's
native form (@ref file_ascii) is always available.  ROOT ntuple like
files (@em .root) and FITS files (@em .fits) are also available if @b
HippoDraw was configured with those options.  The example below shows
the file dialog for opening a ROOT ntuple file.

@image html canvasfiledialog.png File dialog window.
@image latex canvasfiledialog.eps File dialog window.

By using the <b> File type: </b> combo box, one selects the type of
file to open.  As shown above, one is selecting a ROOT file that is in
the form of an %NTuple. See @ref ntuple_roottuple for description of
what ROOT files are supported.  Other supported format are @b FITS
tables and <b> HippoDraw's </b> ASCII text file, see @ref file_ascii
for details.

The last available selection in the <b> File type: </b> combo box is
@em all @em files.  When this is selected, the @b HippoDraw tries to
open the file with specific formats, like FITS, and it fails, tries
plain text tuple.  If it fails, then an error dialog is raised.

The <b> Save All </b> menu item saves the canvas and any @ref
ntuple_root objects that were created in memory and not yet saved to a
file.  The data source is saved is the same directory as the canvas and
given a file name the same as the canvas document with integer index
appended, but with the suffix @em .tnt.  Thus if the document file
name is @em foo.hpo, then the first %NTuple file name will be @em
foo0.tnt.  The menu item <b> Save All As... </b> allows one to save
the document and its %NTuple objects to a different filename and the
<b> Save All </b> is equivalent to it if the document has not yet been
saved.

The @b Close menu items closes the current canvas window.  If changes
have been made to it, the users is prompted to save them, discard the
document, or canceling the action.  If only one canvas window is
active, then closing it will also terminate the application.

The <b> Save selected as image.. </b> menu item saves one or more
selected canvas items to an image file.  The image format is chosen
by the file type selected.  At least 9 formats are available including
the popular EPS, JPEG, and PNG formats.  GIF format is also available
if @b HippoDraw was built with a Qt library configured to support GIF.

If more than one canvas item is selected, the image file will be the
size of the rectangle enclosing all the selected canvas items.  Their
relative positions are conserved in the image file.

The <b> Create NTuple... </b> menu item allows one to create a new
NTuple with selected cuts and columns.  The dialog is shown below.

@image html canvascreatentuple.png Create NTuple dialog window.
@image latex canvascreatentuple.eps Create NTuple dialog window.

Using the <b> Data Source </b> combo box, one can select the source NTuple.  
The cut and column lists are used as filters to generate the new ntuple.  
After input the ntuple name and click the <b> Create NTuple </b>
button, one can see the new ntuple in the inspector.


The <b> Export text ntuple.. </b> menu item allows you to save a
%NTuple to a file in the ASCII file format supported by @b
HippoDraw. See @ref file_ascii for details.

The @b Print menu items prints the canvas.  A print dialog is first
presented with the standard options of choosing a printer or creating
a Postscript file.

The <b> Recently opened files </b> menu item allows you to open a file
that is recently opened. The sub menu keeps five recently opened files.

The @b Exit menu item terminated the application.  If there are any
modified and unsaved canvases, the user is prompted to save or discard
those changes.



@subsection canvas_edit_menu Edit menu

The @b Edit menu item controls some editing actions on the canvas
items.  It is shown below.

@image html menu_edit.png Edit menu
@image latex menu_edit.eps Edit menu

The actions of most of the menu items is pretty obvious.  The icon
used by the tool bar control is show alongside the menu item along
with its keyboard shortcut, if any.   

The @b Cut, @b Copy, and @b Paste menu items have actions like most
applications today and use the standard set of keyboard short cuts.
@b Cut first makes a copy of the selected items to @b HippoDraw's
pasteboard then removes the items from the canvas.  @b Copy makes a
copy of the selected items to @b HippoDraw's pasteboard.  @b Paste
copies the items on @b HippoDraw's pasteboard to the canvas.  If an
item is selected on the canvas, the pasting is done near it.  The @b
Delete menu item is like @b Cut except that a copy is not made to the
pasteboard.

@note With this release, @b HippoDraw's pasteboard is not the system
pasteboard.  It is expected that in a future release, one will be able
to copy and pasted canvas items between @b HippoDraw and other
applications.

The <b> SelectAll </b> menu item will put all canvas items in the
selected state.

By default, items are inserted in the canvas, either from the @ref
inspector_root or by one of the @ref pythonoverview_root, on a grid.
The size of the items is such that two items horizontally and three
items vertical fit the selected paper size without falling on the page
break.  The user can resize and move the items around after they are
inserted.  Sometimes, he make a mess.  The @b Retile menu item will
move and resize all canvas items so that the default grid is
re-established while the @b Retile @b page will re-tile only the
current page.

@note With this release, the default paper size is US. Letter.  In
future release it is expected that the user will be able to select
other sizes as a preference.

The @b Undo menu items un-does what ever actions changed the selected
canvas item.  They way it works is that a copy of the item is made
when it is first selected.  The @b Undo action first removes the
selected item, than inserts the copy that was made.

The <b> Clear All </b> removes all items from the canvas.  Since this
operation can not be un-done, the user is prompted to acknowledge he
wants this action.



@subsection canvas_view_menu View menu

The @b View menu controls some aspects of the view the canvas without
modifying and canvas items.   It is shown below.

@image html menu_view.png View menu
@image latex menu_view.eps View menu

By the default, pages are added to the canvas automatically as new
canvas items are inserted.  The <b> Add page </b> allows the user to
manually add a page.

@note With this release, there's no control to remove empty pages.
However, empty pages will not be printed.

Canvas Items can be @em locked on the canvas so that they can not be
accidentally moved or resized.  The @b Lock menu item locks the
selected item, while the @b Unlock menu item will unlock locked items.

The <b> Zoom in </b> and <b> Zoom out </b> menu items enlarge and
un-enlarge the canvas.  Zooming in might be useful for viewing details
without resizing the item.  Zooming out allows one to see more plots as
thumbnails without resizing all the items.

@note With this release, the point zoomed into is ill defined.

The <b>Show pick table </b> opens a window with a table of picked
points. The table is shown below.

@image html pick_table.png The pick table
@image latex pick_table.eps The pick table

With the pick mode selected, one can right click with the mouse to
pick a point on the selected plot.  Upon release of the right mouse
button, the X, Y, and Z, if applicable, point is added to the table
along with pick number.  An %NTuple is also created in memory with the
contents of the pick table.  It can be used to create other plots.
If the <b>Show picked points</b> checkbox is checked, a ScatterPlot 
data representation is added to the selected plot which displays the 
contents of the %NTuple.  As additional picks are made, the %NTuple 
is updated, along with any plots bound to that %NTuple.  The table may 
be sorted by any column by clicking on labels at the top of the pick 
list.  The first click on a column label sorts that column in ascending 
order.  The second click on the same column changed the sorting order 
to descending.  Further clicks toggle the sorting order.  The %NTuple 
is also sorted. and the pick table always represents the current contents 
of the %NTuple. In addition to picked points, one can also use 
<b>Add entry</b> button to input data into the pick table.

The <b>Show plot table </b> opens a window with a table of all the
items on the canvas.   The table looks like this.

@image html plot_table.png The plot table
@image latex plot_table.eps The plot table

The items' title, data representation type, the binding to the X and Y
axes, and optionally the Z axis is shown.  One can sort any column by
clicking the the column's label.  Clicking on an entry in the table
will select that item on the canvas.

The next three items control the range of data being displayed on the
selected plot.  The <b>Range zoom</b> toggles the range zoom mode.
When in the mode, one can select a rectangle with the left mouse
button For 2D plots, such as a histogram, the range of the X axis will
change to be the size of the width of the rectangle.  For 3D plots,
such as a contour plot, both the X and Y axis will be changed to the
size of the rectangle.  When not in range zoom mode, the right mouse
is used for selection and moving the plot as described above.

One can zoom the range multiple times.  The <b>Previous range </b>
takes one back one range, while the <b>Next range</b> takes one
forward.  Each save range is in a circular buffer so when there is on
@em next or @em previous range, one wraps around to the other end of
the buffer.

The next four items are the modes used to change the range of cut and to
pick points in the plot. One can see and edit the picked table as decribed
above. The difference of the three cut modes is described in @ref 
canvas_mouse section.

One can group several views into a group view using the <b>Group View</b>. 
The group view can move and resize as a single view. One can also perform 
set cut and pick point operations in any single view in the group. The
<b>Ungroup View</b> ungroup the group view into several single views.



@subsection canvas_view_settings Settings menu

The <b> Setting </b> menu allows one to configure certain aspects of
<b> HippoDraw </b> along user preferences and save them for future
sessions.  The menu looks like this.

@image html canvaswindowsettings.png The settings menu
@image latex canvaswindowsettings.eps The settings menu

The settings are grouped by settings for the @b Canvas, default @b
Fitter, the @b Printer, and default @b Fonts.

Under Unix like systems, such as Linux, the settings are saved in the
<em>.qt/hippodrawrc</em> of the user's home directory.  Under
Windows, the settings are saved in the Windows Registry.

With the <b> Canvas </b> menu item, one can adjust the default size,
plot matrix, and other attributes.  The canvas setting panel is shown below.

@image html canvaswindowsettingsdialog.png The canvas settings dialog
@image latex canvaswindowsettingsdialog.eps The canvas settings dialog

The first box sets whether the plots are lay outed in portrait or
landscape mode.  The Plot Matrix box sets how may plots are displayed
horizontally and vertically for each page.  The Added plots radio
buttons control whether newly added plots from should be selected or
not.  If selected, the canvas scrolls to make the selected plot
visible.  The Printer Margin box set whether the printer margin is
display on the screen or not.

The <b> Save @& Retile </b> button will save the settings and rearrange the
plots on the current canvas for the new settings if necessary The @b
Retile button retiles the current canvas but does not changing the
save settings.  The @b Cancel button will close the dialog without
making any changes.

With the @b %Fitter menu item, one can select the default minimizer -
objective function combination.  It can be overridden during any
session by a selection on the @ref inspector_functions dialog.

With the <b> Printer </b> menu item, one can configure the printer
settings.  With this release, only the page size and orientation is
save. 

If the @b Fonts menu item is selected, a standard font dialog panel is
presented. This controls the fonts used by the plots (not the fonts in
various dialogs and windows.

With the <b> Default toolbar </b> menu item, one can set the toolbars
to the default position, which is in the top dock area. One can drag
and drop any toolbar to anywhere. The positions will also be saved.

@subsection canvas_view_about About menu

The @b Help menu contains items.   It looks like this ...

@image html canvaswindowhelp.png The help menu
@image latex canvaswindowhelp.eps The help menu

The first item is the built-in help for the @b HippoDraw application
using the Qt Assistant application.  Its use is pretty obvious and it
itself has built-in help.   Here's what it looks like ...

@image html canvaswindowassistant.png The Qt Assistant
@image latex canvaswindowassistant.eps The Qt Assistant


The @b About menu brings up the version number of the application and
and credits to those that contributed.  Also version numbers of
external packages that the application was created with and their
version number if available.

The @b About @b Qt menu brings up information on the version of Qt that
was used.

   This directory contains source code that implements design patterns
taken from the text book "Design Patterns, Elements of Reusable
Object-Oriented Software" by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson,
and John Vlissides (The Gang of Four) and elsewhere.

   This directory could be a separate package, but it is kept here as
a convenience to HippoDraw developers.

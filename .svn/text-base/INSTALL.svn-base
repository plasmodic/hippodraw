dance.  If you are familiar with the GNU auto-tools, you can probably
figure out how to install HippoDraw by doing a ...

> ./configure --help

and supplying the options needed for your system.

If this fails, or you want to read

http://www.slac.stanford.edu/grp/ek/hippodraw/install_notes.html

for detailed instructions, .  Or, if you are off the internet, then
the file doc/install.txt is the source for the Doxggen generated
doumentation pointed to above.

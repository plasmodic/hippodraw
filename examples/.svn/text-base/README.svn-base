aptuple.tnt
--------------

   This is an ASCII text file containing data from CERN's personal
database dating from the early '80s.  It was used for examples in the
tutorial for the PAW program that was written at CERN.  Particle
physicists call this a `n-tuple' file, although an n-tuple is really
one row of the file.   One can read this file with the `Import
TextTuple' menu item.

   The format of the file is as follows...

- The first line is taken as a title.

- The next line has tab delimited labels for the columns. This also
  determines the number of columns.

- All the remaining lines are taken as white space delimited data,
  taken row by row.

I'm told that spreadsheet programs, such as Excel, can save data
tables in this format.   This has not been tested.


output.txt
---------
   Another example text file.

userAlg.root
------------
   An example ROOT file.   Can be read with the RootPython package.

   
Z0Strip.data
-------
   This ASCII text file contains data from the Mark II detector run at
the SLAC Linear Collider (SLC).  It is a measurement of the mass of
the Z0 particle.  Its format is the same as above.  It has been sort
by energy to illustrate the Strip Chart display.


hippodemo.py
------------
   This Python program illustrates how to use HippoDraw from a JPython
session.  It reads the `aptuple.hiptxt' file and creates the columns
of data.  The result is the same as using the `Import TextTuple' menu
item. 

For more examples of Python scripts, see the `testsuite' directory.


init.py.in
----------

   A simple script to open an NTuple file.  In the install directory,
the `.in' suffix is removed.

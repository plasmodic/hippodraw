   Instructions for installing the HippoDraw Python extension module with SIP

   You only need to build this extension module if you want to use
HippoDraw with PyQt.  PyQt is a Python extension module for Qt. Its
home page is here:

PyQt's extension module is built with SIP.   The SIP home page is here:

HippoDraw has been built with various versions of SIP and PyQt.
However, to support throwing exceptions in C++ that are converted to
Python exceptions, one needs SIP 3.8 or later.   

This release was tested with SIP 4.2.1.  Staring with SIP 4.0,
incompatible changes were made compared to prior versions and then
again with SIP 4.2.  These changes make it rather difficult for a
configure script to generate a correct Makefile for older versions of
SIP.  Also SIP version 4.2 fixes some significant memory leaks.  Thus,
only SIP 4.2 is later is supported by HippoDraw.

You'll need both SIP and PyQt installed to build HippoDraw's SIP based
extension module.  You must install them in the site-packages
directory of the Python you are using.  That is, if Python is in
/usr/local, then the SIP executable is in /usr/local/bin and the SIP
and PyQt header files are in /usr/local/include/python2.4 and the PyQt
extension module are in /usr/local/lib/python2.4/site-packages.

   To enable building the SIP HippoDraw module, add
`--enable-sipbuild' to the top level conifigure command.  Next exam
the sip/Makefile.  This file may not have been configured correctly.
Correct the line

    SIP = /usr/local/bin/sip

to the path to the SIP executable.   Also the line

    PYQT_SRCS = -I /usr/local/share/sip -I /usr/local/share/sip/qtcanvas

needs to the path to your installed PyQt .sip sources.  Lastly, find
the lines

sipsihippocmodule.h : $(SIP_SRCS) 
	@echo creating built sources
	$(SIP) -e -g -c . $(PYQT_SRCS) -I $(top_srcdir)/sip  \
	-t Qt_3_2_0 -t WS_X11 $(top_srcdir)/sip/sihippo.sip

Correct the `Qt_3_2_0' to the version of Qt you are using or the
latest available in the /usr/local/share/sip/qt/versions.sip file.
  
   You can now build HippoDraw in the normal fashion from the top
level build directory.  If your build fails because of missing header
files in the form `sipqtQXxxxxx.h', then you are using an older
version of Qt then the HippoDraw distribution was built on.  Part of
the distribution build addes all dependencies to the Makefile.in file.
You can safely edit your Makefile to remove all such dependencies.
Less than a half dozend files are envolved.

  The SIP Python extension module will be sihippo.  A "make install"
will install it the Python site-packages subdirectory.

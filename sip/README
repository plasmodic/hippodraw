   This directory contains source code for building a HippoDraw Python
extension module using SIP, see

   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/index.php

for overview.   SIP is used to build PyQt, see

   http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/index.php

It appears that in order to use PyQt, a SIP based HippoDraw Python
extension moulde must be used as there are conflicts with a
Boost.Python based one.

   By default, this module will not be built.  It requires that SIP
and PyQt have been installed.  It also requires access to PyQt source
code.  To build it, first edit the Makefile.am file in this directory
to set the PYQT_SRCS macro to the path to the PyQt SIP source
code. Then run configure with the `--enable-sipbuild' option.
